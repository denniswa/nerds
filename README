Network Enterprise Resource Discovery System

This is a collaborative effort between initially NorduNET and Stockholm university
to collect reusable data about "stuff" on our networks.

The basic idea is to have producers that discover things about your "stuff" and
store it in a loosly specified format (currently JSON based).

After that, you can build consumers of that data that do something valuable to you,
for example generate monitoring system configuration for all services you discovered
when scanning your server networks.

The defined interface of a producer is simple : an executable file.

  Producers MUST accept '--help' and '-h' to produce usage information.

  Producers MUST accept '-O /path/to/output/repo'.

  Producers MUST NOT write anywhere in the repo besides in
    /path/to/repo/producer/$name_of_producer

  Producers SHOULD put JSON output in
    /path/to/repo/producer/$name_of_producer/json



The structure of the produced output is to be documented here shortly.
